# Maze

This project is live at endpoint http://mmaazzee.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 

Generates a maze using the recursive backtracker algorithm. Allows a player to then traverse the maze.

A Typescript project in the Angular framework.

This base project is complete. Next steps are to move state to firebase so that 2 player mode is enabled between machines. This is being done in the MazeBattle repo.
